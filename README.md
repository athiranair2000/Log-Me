# Log-Me


Design documentation for a mini web application Log-Me.

## Overview

Log-Me begins with Login if he/she is a current user or register if he is a new user. Registration has been made more secure by keeping a key bound for passwords, certain common passwords and easily typed ones like qwerty,123 and user names are unacceptable. Email is sent to the user via mail servers to log in.

If these procedures go on fine, a person is directed to a page displaying Hello with a username. Log-Me can be used as a platform by most of the apps to create their login feature. It follows a secured format in user login.
